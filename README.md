- Mark tasks as complete with a checkbox.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Disable the submit button when the input is empty.
- Validate the form input for better user experience.
- Built using modular JavaScript with an OOP approach.

## Technology

- CSS3 for styling
- JavaScript (ES6+) for logic and interactivity
- DOM manipulation for dynamic UI updates
- Git & GitHub for version control and deployment
